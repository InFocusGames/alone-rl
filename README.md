# roguelike
Simple single-player ANSI roguelike. It's intended as a toy project to learn a bit about single-player game programming
(and also specifically to learn artemis-odb) without the hassle of game physics and most importantly graphics.

If it ever becomes remotely playable, I'll give it a name.
